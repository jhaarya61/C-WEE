        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Our product is made using seaweed, being an eco-friendly alternative which does not harm our environment.
            C-WEE is a product made out of seaweed and that very seaweed is converted into a biodegradable tensile bag which when mixed in water dissolves.
